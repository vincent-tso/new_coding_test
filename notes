## Woven Monopoly

### Your task
* Load in the board from board.json
* Implement game logic as per the rules
* Load in the given dice rolls files and simulate the game
  * Who would win each game?
  * How much money does everybody end up with?
  * What spaces does everybody finish on?
  
Implement game logic - Use MVC pattern to structure game design

### Models

4 Players (Player model)

Player model
- name
- money
- position

Property model
- name
- price
- colour
- type
- owner

### Thoughts

Controller records Player's position and Property associated with Player(s)
Player model needs attribute to record position
Property model needs attribute to record owner or availability

How are the Player and Property associated?
Player has 0 or more Properties
Property is owned by 1 Player
